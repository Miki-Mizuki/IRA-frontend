    "reasoning": "\"The print function expects a string to be properly formatted with matching quotes. Here, the string 'Hello' is opened with a single quote but not closed, causing a syntax error.\"",
    "answer": "We must show the mistaken code and then the corrected one. However, note that the problem says \"the mistaken code and the corrected line\". Since the entire code is one line, we can show:\n\nMistaken code: `print('Hello)`\nCorrected code: `print('Hello')`\n\nBut the instruction says: \"the mistaken code and the corrected line of Python code only\"\n\nSo we write:\n\n```python\nprint('Hello)\nprint('Hello')\n```\n\nWait, but that would be two lines? Actually, the problem says to return the mistaken code and the corrected line. So we are showing both? But note the example output format isn't specified beyond that.\n\nAlternatively, we might just show the corrected line? But the instruction says: \"the mistaken code and the corrected line\".\n\nLooking back: \"Answer: <the mistaken code and the corrected line of Python code only, without any additional explanation>\"\n\nSo we have to include both. How? We can write:\n\nMistaken code: \n```python\nprint('Hello)\n```\n\nCorrected code:\n```python\nprint('Hello')\n```\n\nBut the instruction says to put the answer in one block? And without any extra text.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\n```python\n# Mistaken code\nprint('Hello)\n# Corrected code\nprint('Hello')\n```",
