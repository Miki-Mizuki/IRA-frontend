    "answer": "Original: print('Hello) â†’ Corrected: print('Hello') However, note that the original code in the problem is written as `print('Hello)` which is missing the closing quote. But in the corrected version, we add the closing quote. But wait, what if the user intended to use a different string? The problem doesn't specify, so we just fix the immediate error. Alternatively, we could also consider using double quotes, but since the original used a single quote, we'll stick to that. Therefore, the response should be: Hint: There's a missing closing quote for the string. But the instruction says: \"without revealing the fix\". So we should avoid saying how to fix it, just hint. Actually, the hint should be: \"Check for a missing closing quote.\" But let me see the example format: \"Hint: <a one-sentence hint that guides the user toward the issue, without revealing the fix>\" So I'll write: Hint: The string passed to print is missing a closing quote. But that almost reveals the fix. Alternatively, we can say: Hint: There is an unmatched single quote. But the problem says \"without revealing the fix\", meaning we shouldn't say to add a quote, but we can point to the symptom. Alternatively, we can say: Hint: The syntax error might be due to an unbalanced parenthesis or quote. But in this case, it's clearly a quote.",
